https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6046ac12-34eb-4115-b5e6-ba5ff080b479

## 📌 Overview
This **Power BI dashboard** is designed to **analyze and visualize** the verses of the *Bhagavad Gita* in an **interactive and structured** way. It allows users to **explore chapters and verses** while providing their meanings in **Sanskrit, Hindi, and English**. The dashboard goes beyond just data representation—it serves as a **guidance tool**, helping users find **relevant verses** for different life situations, making the timeless wisdom of the *Bhagavad Gita* more accessible and actionable.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**, and an additional **"Situation"** sheet was created with the following columns:
- **Situation**: Describes a real-life scenario.
- **Chapter**: The chapter number related to the situation.
- **Verse No.**: The specific verse that provides guidance for the situation.

## 🛠 Features

### 🔹 **Page 1: Gita Insights**
- **Cards** displaying the total number of chapters and verses.
- **Column Chart**: *Distribution of Verses by Chapters*.
- **Line Chart**: *Chapter-wise Verses by Krishna, Arjun, Sanjay & Dhritarashtra*.

### 🔹 **Page 2: Verse Navigator**
- **Cards** for **Chapter Name, Verse Number, and Adhyay (Section Name)**.
- **Slicers** to filter by **Chapter & Verse**.
- **Translations** of verses in **Sanskrit, Hindi, and English**.

### 🔹 **Page 3: Guidance by Situation (A Unique Feature)**
This is the **most distinctive and impactful** part of the project. It was inspired by the idea that specific **chapters and verses** of the *Bhagavad Gita* provide guidance for different **life challenges**. 

💡 **How It Works:**
1️⃣ **Select a Situation** – Choose a real-life challenge or dilemma.
2️⃣ **Filter by Chapter** – Based on the situation, the relevant chapter is suggested.
3️⃣ **Choose a Verse** – Select a verse from that chapter.
4️⃣ **Get Translations** – Instantly view the **Sanskrit text, Hindi meaning, and English translation** of the chosen verse.

🚀 **Why This is Unique:**
- Instead of randomly searching for wisdom, users can **directly find solutions tailored to their situation**.
- This feature transforms the *Gita* into a **practical guide for modern-day life**.
- It makes ancient knowledge **relevant and easy to apply** in everyday situations.
